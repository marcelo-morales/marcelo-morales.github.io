About Me
/assets/images/about/me.jpg
Hi! My name is Kristen Kwong.
I'm a software engineer currently located in beautiful Vancouver, Canada. I've been studying Computer Science at the University of British Columbia since 2015. I'll be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in May 2020 with 15 months of work experience in software development.

I've had an interest in working with computers since learning to write Tumblr themes with HTML & CSS and designing graphics with Photoshop and Illustrator in the 7th grade. Playing video games also sparked my interest in programming.

Previously, I've interned at Apple as a Software Engineering Intern and Netgear as a Software Test Engineer. I have experience in a variety of areas, including iOS development, automation and full-stack web development. I'm interested in building strong ecosystems of systems, and enjoy learning about hardware, operating systems, and distributed systems.

One of the most rewarding experiences of university was co-founding UBC Hacks in 2016, where I organized two annual Local Hack Days, focussing on making the tech community more inclusive, accessible, and diverse. I was also in charge of branding, marketing, and design. In 2018, we joined with nwPlus to make UBC Local Hack Day 2018 bigger and better, where I became the Co-Director of LHD.

I'm passionate about tech education; I believe that learning about how the world is impacted by technological advancements is beneficial to people of all backgrounds and fields. I really enjoyed working as a Teaching Assistant for the introductory Computer Science course at UBC. I've also volunteered for GirlSmarts4Tech and Canada Learning Code.

I love what I do, and I'm privileged to have the opportunity to work with and learn from some really amazing people in academia and industry. I'm always looking for opportunities to further develop my skills, and positively impact those around me with meaningful work.

You can find me online on Twitter, LinkedIn, or through email. When I'm not coding, I'm probably travelling, listening to music, eating brunch, drawing, and/or playing video games (not necessarily but possibly at the same time).
