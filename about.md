# Hi! My name is Marcelo Morales

I'm a college student currently located in the beautiful but small  <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hackettstown,+NJ+07840/@40.855332,-74.843694,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c3830a6cbf6f6b:0x6cfe40eae1601732!8m2!3d40.8539879!4d-74.8290555">Hackettstown, New Jersey</a>. I've been studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a> since 2019. I'll be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in May 2020.

Although I wish I could say I had an interest with computers and programming at an early age, that is not the case particularly me. My first interests were biology, since living right next to a forest in my family home in NJ, I would always go for hikes and be excited by the different forms of life right at my doorstep. Biology was always on my radar, but I greater passion incited inside of me when I took an intro to CS class at Johns Hopkins. I loved solving probelms in a variety of business, scientific and social contexts, so I followed my interest and enrolled in more CS clases next semester.

And... here I am. I am bracing myself for (virtual) school, but I will try to make the best of it. 

I love what I do, and I'm privileged to have the opportunity to work with and learn from some really amazing people in academia and industry. I'm always looking for opportunities to further develop my skills, and positively impact those around me with meaningful work.

You can find me online on <a href="https://twitter.com/kristenkwng">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristenkwong/">LinkedIn</a>, or through <a href="mailto:kristenkwong@gmail.com">email</a>. When I'm not coding, I'm probably travelling, listening to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/spider-man-into-spider-verse-soundtrack-from-inspired/1445949265">music</a>, eating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kristenvsfood/">brunch</a>, drawing, and/or playing video games (not necessarily but *possibly* at the same time).
